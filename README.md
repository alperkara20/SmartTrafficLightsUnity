# Smart Traffic Light System

## Overview
The **Smart Traffic Light System** is a real-time traffic optimization simulation developed using **Unity 3D**. The system dynamically adjusts traffic light durations based on real-time vehicle detection data using **computer vision** and **optimization algorithms**. 

## Features
- **Real-time vehicle detection** using a trained **neural network model**.
- **Dynamic traffic optimization** to reduce waiting times at red lights.
- **Four-way intersection simulation** with visualized traffic flow.
- **User interface with multiple camera angles** (top-down, 30-degree view, and individual lane views).
- **Randomization and vehicle speed controls** for enhanced testing.
- **Carbon emission analysis** before and after optimization.

## Technologies Used
- **Unity 3D** (Simulation environment)
- **C#** (Scripting in Unity)
- **Python, TensorFlow, Keras** (For training the neural network model)
- **ONNX** (Neural network model format compatible with Unity)
- **Computer Vision Techniques** (Vehicle detection and data processing)
- **Optimization Algorithms** (Adaptive traffic light control)

## Software Development Approach
We followed a hybrid methodology combining the **Waterfall Model** and **Agile Development**:
- **Structured development** for coding, testing, and simulation design.
- **Iterative refinements** based on weekly advisor meetings.
- **Black-box and white-box testing** to validate system performance.

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Unity 2021.3.24f1 (or later)
- Python 3.x with TensorFlow, Keras (for model training)
- ONNX Runtime for neural network inference in Unity

### Steps
1. Open the project in **Unity 3D**.
2. Ensure required **assets and dependencies** are installed.
3. Run the simulation using the Unity Play Mode.

## Testing
- **Black-box testing** to identify edge cases and performance issues.
- **Penetration testing** for input handling in vehicle spawner scripts.
- **White-box testing** to verify algorithm efficiency and system stability.

## Future Improvements
- Integration with **real-world traffic sensors**.
- Implementation of **machine learning-based adaptive algorithms**.
- Enhanced **3D visualization** with real-time analytics.
- Deployment in **smart city infrastructures**.
